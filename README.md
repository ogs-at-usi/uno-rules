- +2 and +4 can be stacked indefinitely, independently of the color chosen by the +4
- multiple cards of the same number with different colors can be played at the same time
- if one doesn't say UNO on time and one says CONTROUNO, the current player draws 2
- the current player doesn't skip the turn when victim of a +2/+4 combo, and has to draw an extra card if no further moves can be made
